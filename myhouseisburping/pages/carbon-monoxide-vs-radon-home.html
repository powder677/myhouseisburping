     Carbon Monoxide vs Radon: What Every Homeowner Must Know
    </h1>
<!-- Direct Answer Box -->
<div class="direct-answer">
<p>
<strong>
       Carbon monoxide (CO) and radon are two separate invisible killers in your home that require different detection methods.
      </strong>
      CO is a toxic combustion gas that poisons you in hours; radon is a radioactive gas from soil that causes cancer over years. You need both a CO detector (which alerts immediately) and radon testing (which measures long-term exposure). Neither gas smells, looks, or makes noise—which is why understanding the difference could save your family's life.

<h2>
     The Core Difference: Acute vs. Chronic Threat
    </h2>
<p>
     Your home harbors two invisible hazards that operate on completely different timescales. Carbon monoxide is an
     <strong>
      acute threat
     </strong>
     —it can knock you unconscious or kill you in a matter of hours if concentrations are high enough. Radon is a
     <strong>
      chronic threat
     </strong>
     —it silently accumulates in your lungs over decades, dramatically increasing your cancer risk.
    </p>
<p>
     Think of CO like a sudden house fire and radon like gradual structural rot. Both are serious, but they demand different responses. A CO detector screams at you immediately; a radon test shows up quietly in a lab result weeks later.
    </p>
<h2>
     What Is Carbon Monoxide and Where Does It Come From?
    </h2>
<p>
     Carbon monoxide is produced whenever fuel—natural gas, propane, oil, wood, or charcoal—burns incompletely. Inside your home, the main culprits are:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Furnaces and boilers
      </strong>
      — the #1 source; cracked heat exchangers leak CO into your living spaces
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Water heaters
      </strong>
      — gas-powered units produce CO as a byproduct
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Fireplaces and wood stoves
      </strong>
      — improperly vented or blocked chimneys force CO indoors
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Gas ranges and ovens
      </strong>
      — using your oven to heat your home is extremely dangerous
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Attached garages
      </strong>
      — running a car engine leaks CO through walls into living areas
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Portable generators
      </strong>
      — never run indoors or even in attached garages
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The danger peaks during winter when heating systems run constantly and homes are sealed tight against cold air. CO is colorless, odorless, and tasteless—your senses are completely useless against it.
    </p>
<h2>
     What Is Radon and Where Does It Come From?
    </h2>
<p>
     Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium in soil and rock beneath your home. It seeps up through foundation cracks, gaps in concrete, and pores in basement walls. Unlike CO, radon isn't created by human activity—it's a geological fact of life in many regions.
    </p>
<p>
     Radon concentrates in your home because houses act like vacuum cleaners. As warm air rises and escapes through attic vents and leaks, negative pressure pulls radon-laden air from the soil. Your basement becomes a radon collection chamber. The EPA estimates radon affects roughly 1 in 3 homes at dangerous levels (above 4 picocuries per liter, or pCi/L).

<h2>
     Health Effects: How Each Gas Harms Your Family
    </h2>
<h3>
     Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Symptoms
    </h3>
<p>
     CO binds to hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in your blood) far more aggressively than oxygen does. This starves your organs of oxygen. Symptoms develop rapidly:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Low-level exposure (35 ppm for 8 hours)
      </strong>
      — mild headache, fatigue, nausea
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Moderate exposure (400 ppm for 3 hours)
      </strong>
      — severe headache, dizziness, confusion, inability to think clearly
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       High exposure (800 ppm for 2 hours)
      </strong>
      — loss of consciousness, potential death
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Very high exposure (1600 ppm for 1 hour)
      </strong>
      — death almost certain
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The problem: these symptoms mimic the flu (headache, nausea, weakness). Families have died thinking they had a stomach bug while their furnace slowly poisoned them. Young children, the elderly, and people with heart disease are at greatest risk.
    </p>
<h3>
     Radon's Long-Term Cancer Risk
    </h3>
<p>
     Radon decays into radioactive particles that lodge in your lungs when inhaled. Over years, this radiation damages lung tissue DNA, causing cancer. The EPA estimates radon causes approximately 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the U.S.—second only to smoking.
    </p>
<p>
     The scary part: you feel nothing. No headaches, no coughing, no warning signs. The only way to know your radon risk is testing. Smokers exposed to radon face an even higher cancer risk than non-smokers.

<h2>
     Detection Methods: How to Know If You're at Risk
    </h2>
<h3>
     Carbon Monoxide Detection
    </h3>
<p>
     A CO detector is your first line of defense. These battery-powered or plug-in devices continuously monitor air and sound an alarm (usually 85+ decibels) if CO levels exceed 35 ppm for 8+ hours or 400 ppm for 15 minutes. Look for detectors certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or CSA.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Where to place CO detectors:
     </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
      At least one on every level of your home
     </li>
<li>
      Near bedrooms so the alarm wakes sleeping family members
     </li>
<li>
      Near fuel-burning appliances (furnace, water heater)
     </li>
<li>
      At breathing height (5–7 feet from the floor) or per manufacturer instructions
     </li>
<li>
      NOT directly above a stove (false alarms from cooking)
     </li>
<li>
      NOT in kitchens near exhaust fans (wind can disperse gas)
     </li>
</ul>
<h3>
     Radon Testing
    </h3>
<p>
     Radon testing is straightforward but requires patience. You have two options:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       DIY test kit
      </strong>
      — EPA-approved kits ($15–$40) measure radon over 2–7 days (short-term). Mail the kit to a lab; results arrive in 2 weeks. Best done in winter when homes are sealed.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Professional radon inspection
      </strong>
      — A certified radon professional uses electronic equipment and follows strict protocols. Costs $150–$300 but provides legal documentation (important for real estate transactions).
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Place your test kit in the lowest living area of your home (basement or first floor), away from doors, windows, and dehumidifiers. Results above 4 pCi/L mean you should install radon mitigation.

<p>
      If your CO detector alarms:
      <strong>
       (1) Get outside immediately
      </strong>
      — leave the house and go outside or to a neighbor's.
      <strong>
       (2) Call 911

      <strong>
       (3) Don't re-enter
