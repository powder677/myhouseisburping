     What is House Burping?
    </h1>
<p class="intro-text">
     The term "House Burping" is a colloquialism that confuses many homeowners because it actually refers to two completely different things. Depending on who you ask, it's either a terrifying noise or a healthy habit.
    </p>
<h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">
     Definition 1: The Noise (Structural Release)
    </h2>
<p>
     Most commonly, a "house burp" is a sudden release of built-up pressure in the building materials. This sounds like a loud pop, bang, or crack. It is caused by the frame of the house adjusting to temperature or humidity.
    </p>
<p>
     This can be environmental (like
     <a href="house-burping-cold-weather.html">
      loud cracks during freezing weather
     </a>
     ) or mechanical. For example, a water heater filled with sediment will make a "popping" sound, often described as
     <a href="water-heater-popping-noise.html">
      burping or kettling
     </a>
     .
    </p>
<h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">
     Definition 2: The Action (Air Exchange)
    </h2>
<p>
     In the context of green building and health, "burping a house" means opening all windows and doors for a short period (10-15 minutes) to rapidly flush out stale, pollutant-filled air and replace it with fresh outdoor air.
    </p>
<p>
     This practice is vital for reducing indoor CO2 levels and managing humidity. For a deep dive into this definition, read our guide on

<h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">
     Which One Do You Have?
    </h2>
<p>
     If you are hearing noises at night, you are experiencing Definition 1. You need to investigate the source. Is it the
     <a href="wind-noises-in-house.html">
      wind rattling the siding
     </a>
     ? Is it
     <a href="house-burping-hvac.html">
      ductwork expanding
     </a>
     ? Or is it something more concerning? Start with our
