     Mouse or House? Distinguishing Pests from Settling Noises
    </h1>
<p class="intro-text">
     Few things trigger insomnia faster than a mysterious sound in the wall at 2 AM. Before you panic, it is vital to distinguish between the biotic (living pests) and the abiotic (structural movement).
    </p>
<h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">
     The Rhythm of the Noise
    </h2>
<p>
     The biggest tell is rhythm. Structural settling is usually singular and sporadic. You might hear a loud pop, and then silence for hours. This is typically just the building materials reacting to
     <a href="house-burping-causes.html">
      various causes like temperature or humidity
     </a>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Pests, however, are industrious. Their noises are repetitive:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Scrabbling/Scratching:
      </strong>
      Usually indicates mice or rats trying to gain traction or gnaw through drywall.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Rolling:
      </strong>
      Often acorns being moved by squirrels in the attic.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Fluttering:
      </strong>
      Indicates birds or bats in the chimney or vents.
     </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">
     Time of Day Matters
    </h2>
<p>
     While thermal expansion happens mostly when the sun hits the roof, thermal
     <em>
      contraction
     </em>
     happens when the sun goes down. This is why many people confuse settling with nocturnal pests. If the noise happens at a precise time every night (e.g., when the heating turns off), review our guide on
     <a href="house-burping-at-night.html">

     </a>
     to rule out mechanical cooling.
    </p>
<h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">
     The "Normalcy" Check
    </h2>
<p>
     If the noise is a dull thud or a wooden creak, ask yourself:
     <a href="is-house-burping-normal.html">
      Is this house burping normal?
     </a>
     In most cases, wood frame compression is standard behavior. However, if the noise is accompanied by the smell of ammonia (urine) or visible droppings, the noise is almost certainly biological.

      💡 Health Insight
     </h3>
<p>
      Pests often seek out areas with high moisture. If you confirm pests, check that area for water leaks, as you may also be facing

     When to Call the Exterminator
    </h2>
<p>
     If you hear vocalizations (squeaking) or rapid movement across a ceiling, it is not the house settling. At this stage, a structural engineer won't help you. You need to know
