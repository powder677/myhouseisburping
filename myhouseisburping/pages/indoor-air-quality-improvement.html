     How to Improve Indoor Air Quality: The Complete Homeowner Guide
    </h1>
<div class="direct-answer">
<p>
<strong>
       To improve indoor air quality, test for radon, improve ventilation by opening windows and using exhaust fans, upgrade to HEPA filters, control humidity between 30-50%, and remove pollution sources like smoke and pet dander.
      </strong>
      Most homes need a combination of these strategies—no single solution fixes poor air quality alone.
     </p>
</div>
<p>
     You spend roughly 90% of your time indoors, yet most homeowners never think about the air they're breathing. Indoor air can be 2–5 times more polluted than outdoor air, according to the EPA. The culprits range from invisible radon gas seeping up from your foundation to off-gassing from new furniture and cleaning products.
    </p>
<p>
     The good news: improving your home's indoor air quality doesn't require expensive overhauls. It starts with understanding what you're dealing with, then tackling the biggest threats first. This guide walks you through every practical step.

<!-- Step 1: Test for Contaminants -->
<h2 id="step-1">
     Step 1: Test for Radon and Other Contaminants
    </h2>
<p>
     Before you buy an air purifier or redesign your ventilation, you need baseline data. What's actually in your air? Radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, and it's invisible and odorless—only testing reveals it.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Start with a radon test.
     </strong>
     You can buy a DIY test kit for $15–$25 at any hardware store (EPA-approved kits are reliable). Place it in the lowest livable level of your home for at least 48 hours (ideally 7–90 days for long-term testing). If you find levels above 4 pCi/L,
     <a href="/pages/radon-gas-in-house-signs.html">
      testing for radon
     </a>
     should be followed by professional mitigation—typically a soil depressurization system that costs $1,200–$2,500.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Consider a professional indoor air quality assessment.
     </strong>
     Some HVAC companies and environmental consultants offer full diagnostics that test for mold spores, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon dioxide levels. This costs $300–$800 but gives you a complete picture of what you're up against.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Check for moisture and mold.
     </strong>
     Use an inexpensive humidity meter (hygrometer) to measure moisture in damp areas like basements and bathrooms. Mold thrives above 60% humidity and releases spores that degrade air quality instantly. If you see visible mold, address the water source first—mold is a symptom, not the problem.
    </p>
<!-- Step 2: Improve Ventilation -->
<h2 id="step-2">
     Step 2: Improve Ventilation—The Foundation of Fresh Air
    </h2>
<p>
     Ventilation is the cheapest, most effective way to dilute indoor pollutants with fresh outdoor air. Modern homes are built tight to save energy, which traps stale air inside. You need to create airflow intentionally.
    </p>
<h3>
     Simple Ventilation Wins (Low Cost)
    </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Open windows strategically.
      </strong>
      Cross-ventilation (opening windows on opposite sides of a room) takes 15–30 minutes to exchange a room's air completely. Do this daily for 10–15 minutes, even in winter. Yes, it costs a bit in heating, but the air quality gain is immediate.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Use bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans.
      </strong>
      These actively pull moist, contaminated air directly outside. Run them during and for 20 minutes after showers and cooking. If you don't have them, installing a basic exhaust fan costs $300–$600 per room.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Clean HVAC vents and return air intakes.
      </strong>
      Dust buildup restricts airflow and recirculates particles. Vacuum or replace filters monthly during heating/cooling season.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Crack a window when using VOC-heavy products.
      </strong>
      Paint, solvents, and cleaning chemicals off-gas heavily for hours. Ventilation is your first defense.
     </li>
</ul>
<h3>
     Advanced Ventilation (Higher Cost, Better Results)
    </h3>
<p>
     If simple measures aren't cutting it, consider mechanical ventilation.
     <a href="/pages/how-to-burp-your-house-ventilation.html">
      The ventilation technique
     </a>
     of "burping your house" involves purposefully opening windows and doors to force complete air exchanges, but mechanical systems do this continuously.
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV) or Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV).
      </strong>
      These systems exchange stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air while recovering 70–90% of heating/cooling energy. Cost: $2,000–$5,000 installed, but they work around the clock. Ideal for homes in harsh climates.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Whole-house exhaust fans.
      </strong>
      Installed in your attic, they pull fresh air through your home and exhaust it outside. Best used in spring and fall. Cost: $600–$1,500 installed.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       HVAC system upgrades.
      </strong>
      If your home has forced-air heating/cooling, adding a fresh-air intake duct to your return plenum brings outside air into your system. Costs $500–$1,500 but requires professional installation.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Many homeowners don't realize that
     <a href="/pages/house-burping-allergies-ventilation.html">
      burping your house for ventilation
     </a>
     is one of the simplest, free methods to improve air quality instantly. It's not a permanent solution, but it works in a pinch.

<!-- Step 3: Upgrade Air Filtration -->
<h2 id="step-3">
     Step 3: Upgrade Your Air Filtration System
    </h2>
<p>
     Ventilation brings fresh air in; filtration captures particles before they reach your lungs. Together, they're unstoppable.
    </p>
<h3>
     HVAC Filter Upgrades
    </h3>
<p>
     Your home's furnace and air conditioner already have filters, but most homeowners use the cheap fiberglass ones (MERV 4–7) that barely catch dust. Upgrading is easy and costs just $15–$50 per filter.
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       MERV 11–13 pleated filters.
      </strong>
      Catch 50–85% of particles down to 1 micron (mold spores, dust mite feces, pet dander). Replace monthly. Cost: $15–$25 each. This is the sweet spot for most homes.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       MERV 16+ or sealed HEPA filters.
      </strong>
      Capture 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns and larger (viruses, fine smoke). Need a sealed system and stronger blower. Cost: $50–$150 per filter, replacement every 6–12 months. Recommended if you have allergies or respiratory issues.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Electrostatic filters.
      </strong>
      Washable, reusable, and cheaper long-term, but less efficient than MERV 13. Work well for dust-heavy homes.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
      Important:
     </strong>
     Check your furnace blower—it must be able to handle the pressure drop of high-MERV filters. If it's undersized, high filters starve your system of airflow and reduce efficiency. Call an HVAC pro if you're unsure ($100–$150 for assessment).
    </p>
<h3>
     Portable Air Purifiers
    </h3>
<p>
     If you can't upgrade your whole-house system, portable units work for individual rooms—especially bedrooms where you spend 8 hours sleeping.
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       True HEPA purifiers.
      </strong>
      The gold standard. Look for "True HEPA" (not "HEPA-type"). They remove 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns and larger. Cost: $100–$400. Brands like Coway, Winix, and Levoit are reliable.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Activated carbon filters.
      </strong>
      Capture odors and gaseous VOCs (paint fumes, cooking smell) that HEPA can't touch. Many good purifiers combine HEPA + carbon. Cost: adds $50–$100 to a unit.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       UV-C purifiers.
      </strong>
      Kill bacteria and viruses. Good add-on to HEPA, but not a replacement. Don't buy UV-only units—they don't remove particles.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
      Pro tip:
     </strong>
     Smaller, more powerful units in 1–2 rooms beat a weak unit in a large space. A purifier rated for a 200 sq ft room in a 600 sq ft living room won't keep up. Check the CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating—higher is better.
