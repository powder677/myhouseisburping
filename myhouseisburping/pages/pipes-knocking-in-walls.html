     Pipes Knocking in Walls: Water Hammer Explained &amp; Fixed
    </h1>
<div class="direct-answer">
<p>
<strong>
       That knocking sound in your walls when you turn water on or off is water hammer—a shock wave created when fast-moving water suddenly stops.
      </strong>
      It's caused by high water pressure (above 80 psi), abrupt valve closures, or missing air chambers in your pipes. You can often fix it yourself by draining your system, installing water hammer arrestors, or reducing water pressure at the main valve.
     </p>
</div>
<p>
     Water hammer is one of the most common plumbing noises homeowners hear, and the good news is that it's usually fixable without a full pipe replacement. The bad news? If you ignore it, those repetitive shock waves can eventually damage your plumbing, weaken connections, and lead to costly leaks inside your walls.
    </p>
<p>
     Let's walk through exactly what's happening, why your pipes are doing it, and how to make the noise stop for good.
    </p>
<h2>
     What Is Water Hammer (And Why It Happens)
    </h2>
<p>
     Water hammer occurs when flowing water suddenly stops or changes direction inside your pipes. Picture it like this: water is moving through your pipes at high velocity, and when you close a faucet or a solenoid valve (like in your washing machine) shuts off abruptly, the water has nowhere to go. That kinetic energy converts into a pressure wave that travels backward through the pipes, creating that distinctive
     <strong>
      bang, bang, bang
     </strong>
     sound you hear in the walls.
    </p>
<p>
     The faster the water was moving, or the quicker the valve closes, the louder the shock. That's why you might hear it most when shutting off a garden hose quickly or when your toilet's fill valve suddenly stops refilling.
    </p>
<p>
     Three main factors make water hammer worse:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       High water pressure.
      </strong>
      Most homes should have 40–60 psi of incoming water pressure. When your municipal supply or pressure tank pushes 80+ psi into your pipes, that water moves faster and hits harder when stopped.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Fast-closing valves.
      </strong>
      Modern fixtures like solenoid valves on washers and dishwashers shut off almost instantly, leaving no time for the pressure wave to dissipate.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Missing or waterlogged air chambers.
      </strong>
      Your plumbing should have small air-filled pockets (called air chambers) at the end of supply lines. These cushion the shock. Over time, they fill with water and stop working.
     </li>
</ul>
<h2>
     Diagnosing Where the Knocking Comes From
    </h2>
<p>
     Before you can fix water hammer, you need to know which fixture is causing it. Not all knocking sounds are the same—some are localized to one area, while others echo through your entire house.
    </p>

</div>
<p>
     To pinpoint the source, run a simple test: turn on and off each water-using fixture in your home—kitchen faucet, bathroom sinks, shower, toilet, washer—and listen carefully where the sound comes from. Write down which fixture causes the loudest knocking. That's your starting point.
    </p>
<h2>
     5 DIY Fixes for Pipes Knocking in Walls
    </h2>
<h3>
     1. Check and Reduce Your Water Pressure
    </h3>
<p>
     High water pressure is the number one culprit behind water hammer. Your first step should always be checking your incoming pressure with a simple pressure gauge (about $10 at any hardware store).
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to do:
     </strong>
     Screw the gauge onto an outdoor faucet or hose bib. Turn the faucet on and read the psi. If it's above 80 psi, your pressure is too high. You can reduce it by installing a pressure regulator on your main water line (typically located where the water enters your home from the street). Most regulators cost $30–$60 and are a straightforward installation if you're comfortable with plumbing.
    </p>
<p>
     If you're not comfortable doing it yourself, this is a good reason to call a
     <a href="/pages/when-to-call-a-professional.html">
      professional plumber
     </a>
     —it's a quick job that'll prevent water hammer and extend your plumbing's life.
    </p>
<h3>
     2. Drain and Refill Your Plumbing System
    </h3>
<p>
     Sometimes air chambers in your pipes become waterlogged over time. Draining the system lets those chambers refill with air, restoring their shock-absorbing ability. This is one of the easiest DIY fixes and costs nothing.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to do:
     </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
      Turn off the main water supply valve (usually near the street or in your basement).
     </li>
<li>
      Open every faucet in your home—kitchen, bathrooms, outdoor spigots, everything. Start with the lowest-level faucet first.
     </li>
<li>
      Let water drain for a few minutes until nothing comes out.
     </li>
<li>
      Close all the faucets, starting from the highest point in your home (upstairs faucets) and working down.
     </li>
<li>
      Turn the main water valve back on slowly.
     </li>
<li>
      Test your fixtures. The air chambers should now be recharged and the knocking may be gone.
     </li>
</ol>
<h3>
     3. Install Water Hammer Arrestors
    </h3>
<p>
     A water hammer arrestor is a small device (about the size of a fire extinguisher) that acts as a shock absorber for your pipes. It contains pressurized air and a flexible bladder that absorbs the impact when water stops flowing suddenly.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to do:
     </strong>
     You can install arrestors at specific problem fixtures or on the main supply line. They typically screw onto the incoming water line with a wrench. Most homeowners can do this in 15–30 minutes per unit. They cost $20–$100 depending on size and quality, and professional installation runs $100–$300 if you'd rather have it done.
    </p>
<p>
     Install arrestors closest to the fixture causing the loudest banging—usually near your washer, dishwasher, or toilet.
    </p>
<h3>
     4. Replace Fast-Acting Valve Solenoids
    </h3>
<p>
     If the knocking only happens when your washing machine or dishwasher fills up, the problem is almost certainly the solenoid valve that controls water flow. These shut off nearly instantaneously, which is great for water conservation but tough on your pipes.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to do:
     </strong>
     You can replace the solenoid cartridge itself (usually $30–$60 and a 10-minute job), or install a water hammer arrestor on the inlet hoses. Many modern washers now come with built-in shock arrestors, but older appliances often don't.
    </p>
<h3>
     5. Repair or Adjust Fill Valves in Toilets
    </h3>
<p>
     Toilet knocking is incredibly common and usually easy to fix. The culprit is almost always the fill valve (ballcock) that refills the tank after you flush.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to do:
     </strong>
     Most fill valves have an adjustment screw or clip that controls how fast water flows into the tank. Slowing down the fill rate reduces the shock when the valve closes. Consult your toilet's manual or look for a small screw on the side of the fill valve. Turning it a quarter-turn at a time can reduce the knocking dramatically. If the valve is old or damaged, replace it entirely (kits cost $10–$20).

    </p>
<h2>
     When High Water Pressure Is the Real Problem
    </h2>
<p>
     If you've drained your system and installed arrestors but the knocking persists, your water pressure is almost certainly too high. Municipal water supplies can surge, especially during peak usage times in the morning or evening. Some homes get 80–100+ psi, which is well above the safe range.
    </p>
<p>
     Beyond water hammer, high pressure damages your fixtures, shortens the life of hoses and connectors, and can cause leaks inside walls that you won't see until serious damage has been done. Installing a pressure regulator (or replacing an old one) is the most permanent solution.
    </p>
<p>
     A pressure regulator typically costs $30–$100 in parts and $100–$300 for professional installation. It's one of the best investments you can make for your plumbing's longevity.
    </p>
<h2>
     When to Call a Professional
    </h2>
<p>
     You should reach out to a plumber if:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
      The knocking continues after you've drained the system and installed arrestors.
     </li>
<li>
      You notice water leaking from joints or connections in the walls.
     </li>
<li>
      The noise is accompanied by reduced water pressure at fixtures.
     </li>
<li>
      You're not comfortable working with water pressure gauges or installing valves.
     </li>
<li>
      Your water pressure is consistently above 80 psi and you don't have a regulator.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     See our guide on

     for more details on what signs indicate professional help is needed.
    </p>
<p>
     If you also notice your

     , that's a separate issue often caused by sediment buildup, and should be addressed promptly.
    </p>
<h2>
     Preventing Water Hammer in the Future
    </h2>
<p>
     Once you've fixed the immediate problem, keep these prevention tips in mind:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       Close faucets gently.
      </strong>
      Avoid slamming taps shut. Slow, deliberate closure gives pressure waves time to dissipate.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Monitor your water pressure regularly.
      </strong>
      Check it a few times a year. If it creeps above 80 psi, adjust your regulator.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Drain your system annually.
      </strong>
      Once a year, shut off the main valve and open all faucets to re-charge
     </li>
</ul>
