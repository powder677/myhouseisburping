<h1>
     Attic Noises at Night: What's Up There? (Diagnosis Guide)
    </h1>
<!-- Direct Answer Box -->
<div class="direct-answer">
<p>
<strong>
       Those attic noises at night are almost always one of three things: thermal expansion (wood and metal contracting as temperatures drop), wildlife (rodents, raccoons, bats), or structural movement (roof truss uplift or settling).
      </strong>
      Thermal expansion is normal and harmless. Pests need prompt action. Structural issues warrant professional inspection. Your house is quieter at night, which makes these sounds more noticeable—and more alarming than they usually are.

<h2>
     Why You Hear Attic Noises More at Night
    </h2>
<p>
     Your attic sounds louder after dark for two physical reasons. First,
     <a href="/pages/house-burping-at-night.html">
      why houses are louder at night
     </a>
     comes down to temperature and ambient noise. As evening temperatures drop, every wood beam, metal duct, and fastener in your attic contracts slightly. This creates cracking, popping, and groaning sounds. During the day, the sun heats your roof and attic, expanding materials in the opposite direction—but you're usually awake and busy, so you don't notice.
    </p>
<p>
     Second, nighttime is simply quieter. Traffic noise, HVAC systems, and human activity mask structural sounds during the day. When you turn off the TV and the house settles, that mysterious scratching from the attic suddenly becomes the loudest thing you hear. Your brain is also primed to hear threats at night, making you hyperaware of every creak and thump.
    </p>
<h2>
     The Three Main Causes of Attic Noises
    </h2>
<h3>
     1. Thermal Expansion (Most Common)
    </h3>
<p>
     When temperatures drop at night, wood and metal contract. In an attic with a 40°F temperature swing (from 75°F in afternoon to 35°F at night), materials shrink unevenly. Wood beams, roof trusses, metal ducts, and fasteners all move at slightly different rates. These materials rub against each other, creating cracking, groaning, and popping sounds that can sound like footsteps or thumping.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound is completely harmless. It's the acoustic equivalent of your house "burping"—releasing stress as materials adjust. Houses with newer wood, loose fasteners, or poor insulation tend to be noisier because those materials move more freely. Once you understand this is normal, the noise becomes much less frightening.
    </p>
<h3>
     2. Wildlife and Pests
    </h3>
<p>
     Rodents, raccoons, squirrels, and bats all use attics as shelter. These animals create distinctly different sounds than thermal expansion. Mice and rats make high-pitched
     <em>
      scurrying
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      scratching
     </em>
     noises as they run through walls and across joists. Raccoons produce heavy
     <em>
      thumping
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      dragging
     </em>
     sounds. Squirrels make
     <em>
      chattering
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      gnawing
     </em>
     noises, especially during late fall and winter.
    </p>
<p>
     The key distinction: pest noises are
     <em>
      active and purposeful
     </em>
     . They happen at specific times (often dusk and dawn for raccoons, throughout the night for mice). Thermal expansion happens constantly but intermittently as temperature fluctuates.
     <a href="/pages/house-burping-or-mice.html">
      Learn more about diagnosing pests vs house settling
     </a>
     . If you suspect wildlife, look for dark droppings, urine stains (visible under UV light), entry holes, or chewed wiring in your attic.
    </p>
<h3>
     3. Structural Movement and Roof Truss Uplift
    </h3>
<p>
     Your roof trusses are held together with fasteners and glue. As wood dries over years, or as moisture levels fluctuate seasonally, these connections can loosen.
     <a href="/pages/roof-truss-noises.html">
      Roof truss uplift noises
     </a>
     sound like slow, deliberate popping or cracking—sometimes loud enough to shift ceiling drywall or create gaps around interior walls.
    </p>
<p>
     This is different from the rapid cracking of thermal expansion. Truss noises tend to be singular, dramatic events rather than constant small pops. If you notice ceiling gaps appearing or disappearing seasonally, or if you hear one loud
     <em>
      bang
     </em>
     that shakes the house, have a structural engineer inspect your roof system. Uplift can be corrected with specialized fasteners or strapping.

<h2>
     Step-by-Step Diagnosis Guide
    </h2>
<h3>
     Step 1: Describe the Sound
    </h3>
<p>
     Close your eyes and listen carefully during the next occurrence. Is it a rapid
     <em>
      scratching
     </em>
     (pests), a slow
     <em>
      creak
     </em>
     (thermal), or a sharp
     <em>
      pop
     </em>
     (structural)? Record it on your phone if possible—you can play it back in daylight to identify the source more objectively.
    </p>
<h3>
     Step 2: Note the Timing
    </h3>
<p>
     Does the noise happen every night or only on cold nights? Does it start when the sun sets and continue steadily? Or does it occur at specific times like 10 PM or 3 AM? Thermal expansion peaks as temperature drops most rapidly—usually in the first few hours after sunset. Pests follow daily patterns tied to feeding and activity. Truss uplift is random and singular.
    </p>
<h3>
     Step 3: Check Your Attic (During Daylight)
    </h3>
<p>
     Use a flashlight and climb into your attic carefully. Look for:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
      Dark droppings (small pellets = mice; larger/segmented = raccoon)
     </li>
<li>
      Urine stains (look for dark discoloration on rafters and joists)
     </li>
<li>
      Entry holes, gnawed wood, or damaged insulation
     </li>
<li>
      Visible gaps, cracks, or movement in roof trusses
     </li>
<li>
      Loose or corroded fasteners holding trusses together
     </li>
<li>
      Water damage or mold (indicates moisture issues that can worsen truss movement)
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     If you find pest evidence, stop investigating and call a licensed pest control company. If you see structural damage (sagging trusses, severe rot, large cracks), contact a home inspector or structural engineer.
    </p>
<h3>
     Step 4: Rule Out Easy Fixes
    </h3>
<p>
     Before assuming you have pests or structural problems, check these:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
       HVAC ducts:
      </strong>
      Flexible ducts can vibrate and make noise. Check if ducts are properly secured.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Plumbing:
      </strong>
      Water pipes expand and contract with temperature and water use. Copper and PVC pipes in attics can create dramatic popping sounds.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Loose fasteners:
      </strong>
      Nails and screws can vibrate loose over time. A gentle jostle of roof trusses (from outside, safely) can sometimes quiet them temporarily.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       Attic vents:
      </strong>
      Dampers or louvers can rattle in wind. Listen specifically near the attic vents.
     </li>
</ul>
<h2>
     When to Call a Professional
    </h2>
<!-- Warning Callout -->
<div class="callout-box warning-border">
<h3>
      Safety Warning: Don't Ignore These Signs
     </h3>
<p>
      Call a pest control company immediately if you see droppings, urine stains, or entry holes. Rodent infestations can spread disease and cause electrical fires by gnawing through wiring. Raccoons and bats require specialized removal and can cause structural damage. Call a structural engineer or home inspector if you notice ceiling cracks, gaps around interior walls that appear seasonally, or visible sagging in roof trusses.
     </p>
</div>
<h3>
     Pest Control Professional
    </h3>
<p>
     If you identify rodent droppings, urine, or active gnawing, hire a pest control company licensed in your state. They'll seal entry points and set traps or use humane removal. Do not attempt this yourself—rodent urine is toxic and attic spaces are dangerous to navigate.
