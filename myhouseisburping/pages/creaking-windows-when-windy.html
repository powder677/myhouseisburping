    Why Do My Windows Creak and Whistle in the Wind?
   </h1>
<!-- Direct Answer Box -->
<div class="direct-answer">
<p>
<strong>
      Your windows creak and whistle when windy because wind pressure pushes on the glass and frame, making loose components vibrate or air rush through gaps.
     </strong>
     The most common culprits are deteriorated weatherstripping, failed caulk seals, loose sashes, and air leaks around the frame. While the noise itself isn't dangerous, it usually signals that your windows are leaking air—wasting energy and letting in moisture. Most of these problems are easily fixable with caulk, weatherstripping, and hardware tightening.

<section id="types-of-noise">
<h2>
     Three Types of Window Noise — and What They Mean
    </h2>
<p>
     Not all window sounds are created equal. Your windows might creak, whistle, or groan—and each sound tells you something different about what's wrong.
    </p>
<h3>
     Creaking or Groaning
    </h3>
<p>
     A low, rhythmic creaking sound—sometimes like a slow, deep groan—usually means the window sash is moving slightly in its frame as wind pressure pushes on the glass. This happens when the sash has too much play (looseness) inside the frame, often because:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
      The rope or spring mechanisms in older double-hung windows are worn out
     </li>
<li>
      Hardware is loose or corroded
     </li>
<li>
      The frame has settled or shifted slightly due to house movement
     </li>
</ul>
<h3>
     Whistling
    </h3>
<p>
     A high-pitched whistle or squeal means air is flowing through a narrow gap at high speed. This is the classic sign of an air leak—wind is literally forcing its way through cracks in the weatherstripping, caulk, or frame. The smaller and more turbulent the air gap, the higher the pitch.
    </p>
<h3>
     Rattling
    </h3>
<p>
     A sharp, rapid clicking or tapping indicates the sash or hardware is vibrating against the frame. This often happens when latches are loose, stops aren't tight, or the sash has swollen slightly in humid conditions and is binding.
    </p>
</section>
<!-- Section 2: Why It Happens -->
<section id="why-it-happens">
<h2>
     The Physics: Why Wind Makes Windows Talk
    </h2>
<p>
     Wind doesn't just whisper past your windows—it exerts real, measurable pressure on them. Here's how the noise starts:
    </p>
<h3>
     Air Pressure and Force
    </h3>
<p>
     A moderate wind (20 mph) pushes against your house with significant force. That pressure is unevenly distributed around your windows—the windward side experiences much higher pressure than the leeward side. Your window frame and glass have to flex and adjust to handle this load. If your seals are tight and everything is secure, the noise is minimal. But if there are gaps, the pressure difference creates vibration.
    </p>
<h3>
     Air Leaks and Whistling
    </h3>
<p>
     When air is forced through a tight space at high speed, it creates turbulence. That turbulence produces noise—the same principle that makes wind whistle through a canyon or a keyhole. The smaller the gap, the higher the frequency (higher-pitched whistle). This is actually useful information: it tells you exactly where the leak is.
    </p>
<h3>
     Loose Components Vibrating
    </h3>
<p>
     Wind also causes subtle vibrations in any component that isn't perfectly secured. A loose sash, a slightly bent weather strip, corroded hardware, or even old caulk that's partially failed can all vibrate under pressure, creating creaking, groaning, or rattling sounds.
    </p>
<p>
     The good news: unlike
     <a href="/pages/wind-noises-in-house.html">
      other wind noises in your house
     </a>
     , window creaking is usually easy to diagnose and fix because you can see and access the problem directly.
    </p>

<!-- Section 3: Common Causes -->
<section id="common-causes">
<h2>
     The 5 Most Common Causes of Creaking, Whistling Windows
    </h2>
<h3>
     1. Failed or Deteriorated Caulk
    </h3>
<p>
     Caulk around the outside of your window frame is your first line of defense against air leaks and water infiltration. Over time—typically 5 to 10 years—caulk shrinks, cracks, and pulls away from the frame. Once it fails, wind can push air directly into the gaps. This is the #1 cause of whistling windows.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to look for:
     </strong>
     Visible gaps, cracks, or missing chunks of caulk around the outside of the frame, especially at corners.
    </p>
<h3>
     2. Worn or Damaged Weatherstripping
    </h3>
<p>
     Weatherstripping (the foam, felt, or rubber strips around the sash) compresses over time and loses its seal. Once it's compressed or torn, it can't block air flow or prevent the sash from rattling. Weatherstripping is one of the easiest fixes you can make.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to look for:
     </strong>
     Weatherstripping that's compressed, flattened, cracked, or missing entirely. Run your fingers along it—good weatherstripping should feel springy, not hard and flat.
    </p>
<h3>
     3. Loose or Corroded Hardware
    </h3>
<p>
     Window hardware—latches, locks, hinges, and sash locks—holds everything in place. When bolts loosen or hardware corrodes, the sash can move slightly in the frame, causing creaking and rattling. This is especially common in older windows and coastal homes where salt spray accelerates corrosion.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to look for:
     </strong>
     Bolts or screws that turn easily (loose), visible rust or discoloration, or hardware that feels gritty or stuck.
    </p>
<h3>
     4. Loose or Deteriorated Glazing Putty (Old Windows)
    </h3>
<p>
     If you have older wooden windows, glazing putty holds the glass panes in place. When putty dries out, it shrinks and cracks, allowing the glass to move slightly in its frame. This creates creaking as the glass flexes under wind pressure.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to look for:
     </strong>
     Putty that's hard, crumbly, separating from the glass, or missing in chunks. Modern windows use different methods, but old windows rely heavily on putty.
    </p>
<h3>
     5. Frame Gaps or Settling
    </h3>
<p>
     Houses settle and shift over time, especially as the foundation adjusts and wood dries out. This can open small gaps between the window frame and the house structure. Wind pressure exploits these gaps, causing whistling or creaking. More commonly, the frame itself can have stress cracks or gaps that weren't sealed during installation.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      What to look for:
     </strong>
     Visible gaps between the window frame and wall material (drywall, brick, siding), or gaps along the top and sides that are wider than 1/16 inch.

     Before you start fixing, you need to know exactly where the problem is. Here's how:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
       During windy conditions,
      </strong>
      hold a lit candle or incense stick near different parts of your window (outside frame, sash edges, corners). The flame or smoke will flicker or move where air is leaking in.
     </li>
<li>
<strong>
       At night,
      </strong>
      turn off interior lights and shine a flashlight at the window from outside. You'll be able to see light coming through gaps.
