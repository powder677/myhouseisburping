      Quick Answer
     </h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
<strong>
       Call a professional immediately if house noises are paired with visible cracks, gas or burning smells, water stains, or doors that won't close.
      </strong>
      Match the sound type to the right expert: plumbers for burping/gurgling, HVAC technicians for popping, structural engineers for creaking with cracks, and call 911 for hissing gas leaks or electrical sizzling.
     </p>
</div>
<p>
     We have established on
     <a href="../index.html">
      all house noise and safety guides
     </a>
     that houses are noisy creatures. Most of the time, these sounds are benign conversations between wood, metal, and air. But sometimes, a house "burp" is actually a scream for help.
    </p>
<p>
     Knowing
     <strong>
      when to call an expert for house noises
     </strong>
     can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. If DIY fixes and patience haven't stopped the noise, you need to assess the risk level. This guide distinguishes between "annoying" and "dangerous."

<h2>
      What Are the Top 5 Warning Signs You Need to Call a Professional?
     </h2>
<p>
      If your house is making noises
      <em>
       and
      </em>
      showing any of these symptoms, it is no longer a
      <a href="is-house-burping-normal.html">
       normal house sound
      </a>
      . It is a
      <strong>
       structural concern or safety hazard
      </strong>
      that requires immediate professional evaluation.
     </p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<strong>
        The "Gunshot" + Cracks:
       </strong>
       A loud bang is common in
       <a href="house-burping-cold-weather.html">
        freezing cold weather
       </a>
       . However, if it leaves a jagged crack in your drywall, you need to check if it's just
       <a href="roof-truss-uplift-noises.html">
        roof truss uplift
       </a>
       (cosmetic) or foundation failure (critical). Call a structural engineer for cracks wider than 1/8 inch.
      </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<strong>
        The Hiss + Smell (Gas Leak):
       </strong>
       If you hear a hissing or "burping" sound near a utility line and smell rotten eggs, leave the house immediately and call your gas company or 911. This is a gas leak and poses an explosion hazard.
      </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<strong>
        The Sizzle (Electrical Fire Hazard):
       </strong>
       A buzzing or sizzling sound behind a wall, often accompanied by a fishy or burning plastic smell, indicates arcing wires. This is a fire hazard. Stop using that circuit and call a licensed electrician immediately.
      </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<strong>
        The Wet Thud (Plumbing/Roof Leak):
       </strong>
       If you hear a dull thud or dripping sound in a ceiling, followed by a stain appearing, you have an active plumbing leak or roof failure. Ensure this isn't just
       <a href="house-burping-allergies-ventilation.html">
        condensation from poor ventilation
       </a>
       . Call a plumber or roofer immediately to prevent water damage.
      </li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<strong>
        The Scrabble (Pest Infestation):
       </strong>
       Scratching, scampering, or chewing sounds are not thermal expansion. Review our guide on
       <a href="house-burping-or-mice.html">
        identifying pest noises

       versus settling before calling a pest control professional or builder.

<h2>
      Who Should I Call for Different Types of House Noises?
     </h2>
<p>
      "House burping" is vague. To get the right help quickly, you need to match the sound to the correct trade specialist. This routing guide connects each noise type to the professional who can solve it.
     </p>
<div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #3498db;">
<h3>
       For "Burping," Gurgling, or Drain Noises
      </h3>
<p>
<strong>
        The Pro:
       </strong>
       Licensed Plumber.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>
        Why:
       </strong>
       The issue is likely a blocked vent stack, trapped air, or improper drain slope. However, if the sound is coming specifically from your hot water tank, it may be sediment buildup. Read about
       <a href="water-heater-popping-noise.html">
        water heater popping noises
       </a>
       first to determine if you need a plumber or water heater specialist.

<h3>
       For "Popping," Banging, or Loud Clanging from Ducts
      </h3>
<p>
<strong>
        The Pro:
       </strong>
       HVAC Technician.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>
        Why:
       </strong>
       If the sound syncs with your heat turning on or AC kicking in, it's ductwork thermal expansion or loose ducts. A pro can install flexible transitions, add insulation, or resize ducts to stop the noise and improve system efficiency.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #f39c12;">
<h3>
       For "Creaking," "Cracking," or Floor Sloping
      </h3>
<p>
<strong>
        The Pro:
       </strong>
       Structural Engineer or Foundation Specialist.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>
        Why:
       </strong>
       If the floors slope, cracks are wider than 1/8th of an inch, or if the noise only happens during storms (see:
       <a href="wind-noises-in-house.html">
        wind noises
       </a>
       ), you need a professional assessment. Structural damage can worsen and become expensive if ignored.

<h3>
       For Hissing + Gas Smell
      </h3>
<p>
<strong>
        The Pro:
       </strong>
       Call Your Gas Company or 911 Immediately.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>
        Why:
       </strong>
       This is a gas leak emergency. Do not wait for a professional appointment. Evacuate and call your utility company's emergency line right away. Do not use any electrical switches or create sparks.
      </p>
</div>

<h3>
       For Sizzling, Buzzing, or Burning Smell Behind Walls
      </h3>
<p>
<strong>
        The Pro:
       </strong>
       Licensed Electrician.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>
        Why:
       </strong>
       This indicates arcing wires or overheating circuits. This is a fire hazard. Call an electrician immediately. Do not ignore or defer this repair.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #8e44ad;">

<p>
<strong>
        The Pro:
       </strong>
       Pest Control Specialist.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>
        Why:
       </strong>
       These sounds indicate rodents, squirrels, or insects in your walls or attic. The sooner you call a professional, the sooner you can prevent structural damage and contamination.

<h3>
       For Rumbling or Popping from Water Heater
      </h3>
<p>
<strong>
        The Pro:
       </strong>
       Licensed Plumber or Water Heater Specialist.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>
        Why:
       </strong>
       Sediment buildup in your tank creates these noises and reduces efficiency. A professional can flush the tank or recommend replacement before the tank fails and floods your home. Read more on

    </h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      When should I call a structural engineer?
     </h3>
<p>
      Call a structural engineer if you notice sloping or uneven floors, cracks wider than 1/8 inch in walls or drywall, creaking sounds that intensify during storms or extreme temperature changes, or banging noises that correlate with wind or foundation settling. A structural engineer can determine whether cracks are cosmetic (like roof truss uplift) or indicate serious foundation damage requiring repair.
     </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      What house noises require a professional?
     </h3>
<p>
      House noises requiring professional help include: burping or gurgling from plumbing (call a plumber), popping or banging that syncs with heating or cooling (call an HVAC technician), hissing with gas smell (call your gas company or 911 immediately), sizzling or buzzing behind walls with burning smell (call an electrician), creaking with visible structural damage or sloping floors (call a structural engineer), rumbling from water heater (call a plumber), and scratching or scampering sounds (call pest control). Any noise paired with visible damage, strange smells, or water stains warrants professional evaluation.
     </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      Who do I call for water heater noises?
     </h3>
<p>
      Call a licensed plumber or water heater specialist for water heater popping, rumbling, or hissing noises. These sounds typically indicate sediment buildup in the tank, mineral deposits, or rising pressure that requires professional inspection and possible tank flushing or replacement. Ignoring water heater noises can lead to tank failure and costly water damage to your home.
     </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      What should I do if I hear a gas leak hissing sound?
     </h3>
<p>
      If you hear hissing near a gas line or utility connection and smell rotten eggs (the telltale odor of natural gas), leave your house immediately without using electrical switches or creating sparks. Call your gas company's emergency line or 911 from a safe location outside your home. Do not re-enter the house until the gas company confirms it is safe. Gas leaks pose serious explosion and poisoning hazards.
