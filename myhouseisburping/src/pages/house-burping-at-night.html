         <h1>Why Your House Burps at Night – Explained</h1>

         <p>
            It is 2:00 AM. The street is quiet. You are just drifting off to sleep when—<strong>CRACK</strong>. A loud pop from the attic, followed by a low gurgle from the bathroom.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you have visited our <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>, you know that "house burping" is a physical phenomenon, not a paranormal one. However, the question remains: <strong>Why does it always seem to happen at night?</strong> The answer lies in a combination of rapid temperature changes and human psychology.

        As the temperature drops at night, materials contract, causing the loud "popping" sounds known as thermal contraction.

            <h2>Top 5 Reasons Your House Makes Noises at Night</h2>
            <p>
               <strong>Nighttime house sounds</strong> are distinct from daytime sounds. While the causes overlap, the nighttime environment amplifies specific triggers.
            </p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>Thermal Contraction (The Big Chill):</strong> During the day, the sun heats your roof and siding, causing them to expand. As the sun sets, materials cool rapidly and shrink. This movement creates friction, releasing energy as loud pops.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>The Dropping "Noise Floor":</strong> During the day, traffic and electronics mask subtle sounds. At night, the ambient noise level drops. A sound that is 10 decibels (like a pipe creak) is inaudible at noon but sounds like a gunshot in a <strong>quiet home</strong>.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>Nocturnal Appliance Cycles:</strong> Many water softeners and dishwashers are programmed to run at night. This sudden water usage can cause "water hammer" or drainage burps.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>Frost Quakes (Cryoseisms):</strong> In very cold climates, rapidly freezing groundwater can expand and crack the soil around your foundation, creating a loud boom known as a frost quake.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>Critter Activity:</strong> Unlike your house settling, scratching or scampering sounds at night often indicate rodents who are most active after dark.
               </li>

            <h2>Nighttime Diagnosis: Burping vs. Creaking vs. Popping</h2>
            <p>
               Identifying the sound in the dark can be scary. Here is how to translate the language of a <strong>sleeping home</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
               <h3>The Night Pop</h3>
               <p><strong>Sound:</strong> Sharp crack, like a plastic bottle being crushed.</p>
               <p><strong>Context:</strong> Usually happens in the attic or walls 1-2 hours after sunset.</p>
               <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Normal thermal contraction. See <a href="house-burping-causes.html">Causes</a> for more detail.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
               <h3>The Night Burp</h3>
               <p><strong>Sound:</strong> Glug, gurgle, or bloop.</p>
               <p><strong>Context:</strong> Heard from the toilet or sink when the house is silent.</p>
               <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Plumbing vent issues. Without water running to mask it, you hear the sewer gas trying to escape.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
               <h3>The Night Creak</h3>
               <p><strong>Sound:</strong> Slow groan or squeak.</p>
               <p><strong>Context:</strong> Stairs or floorboards.</p>
               <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Humidity shifts. As the heat turns down at night, wood dries and moves.</p>

            <h3>FAQ: Do these noises indicate damage?</h3>
            <p><strong>Most nighttime noises are harmless.</strong> However, if the "pop" is loud enough to wake you up and you find new cracks in your plaster the next morning, it may be a sign of foundation stress.
