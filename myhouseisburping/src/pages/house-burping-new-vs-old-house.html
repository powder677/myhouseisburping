         <h1>House Burping in New vs. Old Homes: What’s Different?</h1>

         <p>
            A common misconception is that only old, "spooky" Victorian mansions make noise. The reality, as noted on our <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>, is that brand-new construction is often louder than a century-old farmhouse.
         </p>
         <p>
            When comparing <strong>house burping in a new house</strong> versus an older one, we are looking at two different physical processes: <em>Drying</em> vs. <em>Aging</em>. New homes are shedding moisture and tension, while old homes are reacting to gravity and friction.

            <h2>Top 5 Reasons Your House Makes Noises (by Age)</h2>
            <p>
               Whether your home was built in 1920 or 2024 determines the "accent" of its house burping.
            </p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>New Construction (Lumber Drying):</strong> Fresh lumber contains moisture. As a new home goes through its first few heating cycles, the wood dries, shrinks, and twists, creating loud gun-shot style pops.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>Old Homes (Loose Fasteners):</strong> Over decades, nails loosen their grip. When you walk on a floorboard, it rubs against the nail shank, creating the classic "creak."
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>New Construction (Tight Envelope):</strong> New homes are airtight. When a bathroom fan turns on, the change in pressure can cause windows or walls to "burp" or flex if there isn't enough makeup air.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>Old Homes (Drafts):</strong> Gaps in windows and siding allow wind to whistle through, often mistaken for pipe noises.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>Settling Foundations:</strong> While <strong>foundation settling</strong> happens mostly in the first 5 years, older homes can shift again during droughts or floods.
               </li>

               <h3>The 1-Year Rule</h3>
               <p>
                  It is incredibly common for new homeowners to panic at the loud "pops" during the first winter. This is <strong>normal</strong>. Builders often schedule a "1-Year Warranty Walkthrough" specifically to fix the drywall cracks that appear after this settling process.
