         <h1>Top Causes of House Burping and Popping Noises</h1>

         <p>
            To stop the noise, you first have to understand the source. As mentioned on our <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>, a house is not a solid, immovable object. It is a dynamic system comprising thousands of parts held together by nails, screws, and glue.
         </p>
         <p>
            When you ask "Why does my house pop?", the answer is usually found in basic physics: <strong>Thermodynamics</strong> and <strong>Fluid Dynamics</strong>. Below, we break down the specific mechanical reasons your home acts like a living thing.

            <h2>Top 5 Reasons Your House Makes Noises</h2>
            <p>
               While there are many minor sources of noise, these five culprits account for the majority of complaints regarding <strong>house burping</strong> and <strong>floor squeaks</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
               <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                     <strong>Thermal Expansion (The #1 Cause):</strong>
                     <p style="margin-top:5px; font-size: 0.95rem;">Building materials expand in heat and contract in cold. Wood siding, roof trusses, and window frames slide past one another as they change size. When friction holds them back, energy builds up until it releases with a loud <em>POP</em>.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                     <strong>HVAC Duct "Oil-Canning":</strong>
                     <p style="margin-top:5px; font-size: 0.95rem;">Metal ducts are thin. When the furnace kicks on, pressure changes instantly. The metal walls of the duct can pop in or out (like an old oil can), creating a metallic boom. Read more in <a href="house-burping-hvac.html">HVAC & Plumbing Sounds</a>.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                     <strong>Pipe Air Pressure (The "Burp"):</strong>
                     <p style="margin-top:5px; font-size: 0.95rem;">Water flows smoothly, but air does not. If air enters your water supply or drain vents are blocked, bubbles force their way through water traps, creating a distinct gurgling or burping sound.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                     <strong>New Construction Settling:</strong>
                     <p style="margin-top:5px; font-size: 0.95rem;">New lumber contains moisture. As it dries over the first few years, it shrinks and twists. This pulls on nails and screws, causing loud cracking sounds. See <a href="house-burping-new-vs-old-house.html">New vs. Old Homes</a>.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                     <strong>Foundation Shift:</strong>
                     <p style="margin-top:5px; font-size: 0.95rem;">Soil expands when wet and shrinks when dry. This movement puts stress on your concrete slab or basement walls, sometimes resulting in deep, low-frequency groans.</p>

            <h2>How It Works: The Mechanics of Noise</h2>

            <h3>Wood Expansion vs. Contraction</h3>

            <figure style="margin: 1.5rem 0; text-align: center;">
               <img src="../assets/images/thermal-expansion.webp" alt="Diagram showing wood expanding in heat and contracting in cold" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
               <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">
                  Daily temperature cycles cause wood trusses to expand and contract, creating friction noises.
               </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
               Imagine your attic trusses. In the summer, the attic can reach 150°F. The wood expands. At night, it cools to 70°F. The wood shrinks. This daily cycle loosens fasteners and rubs joints together. This is why <strong>wood expansion</strong> is the leading cause of roof noises.
            </p>

            <h3>The "Water Hammer" Effect</h3>

            <figure style="margin: 1.5rem 0; text-align: center;">
               <img src="../assets/images/water-hammer.webp" alt="Illustration of shockwaves in a pipe caused by water hammer" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
               <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">
                  When a valve closes quickly, the stopping water sends a shockwave back through the pipe, causing a loud bang.
               </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
               If you hear a loud bang when a washing machine or toilet shuts off, this is "Water Hammer." Fast-moving water is suddenly stopped, sending a shockwave back through the pipe which slams against the framing of the house.
