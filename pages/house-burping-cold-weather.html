         <p class="intro-text">
            As the thermometer drops, the volume of your home often goes up. Winter is the prime season for strange structural noises. While it can be alarming to hear a loud "crack" when the temperature hits freezing, understanding the physics behind <a href="what-is-house-burping.html">what house burping actually is</a> can alleviate the anxiety.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The Physics of Freezing: Thermal Contraction</h2>
         <p>
            Building materials—wood, vinyl, and metal—all react to temperature changes. In summer, they expand; in winter, they contract. When materials shrink rapidly due to a sudden temperature drop (often seen <a href="house-burping-at-night.html">at night when temperatures plummet</a>), the movement isn't always smooth.
         </p>
         <p>
            This friction builds up potential energy until it releases in a sudden "pop" or "bang." This is particularly common in vinyl siding and metal ductwork, which contract at different rates than the wood frame they are attached to.
         </p>

            <h3 class="text-orange">⚠️ Structural Safety Check</h3>
            <p>While loud, thermal contraction is usually cosmetic. However, if you see widening cracks in your foundation alongside the noise, you need to determine if it is <a href="structural-or-normal.html">structural damage or normal settling</a>.</p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The "Stack Effect" and Pressure</h2>
         <p>
            In winter, the warm air inside your house is significantly lighter than the cold air outside. This warm air rises to the top of your house (the attic), creating high pressure up high and low pressure down low (the basement). This is called the <strong>Stack Effect</strong>.
         </p>

         <p>
            This pressure differential sucks cold air in through the bottom and pushes warm air out through the top. This movement puts stress on your home's envelope. It also forces your <a href="house-burping-hvac.html">HVAC system and ductwork</a> to work overtime, leading to the "oil-canning" or booming sounds of metal ducts expanding and contracting as the furnace cycles on and off.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Is it Just the Cold?</h2>
         <p>
            Sometimes, winter noises are exacerbated by humidity issues. Dry winter air causes wood framing to shrink, potentially pulling away from drywall. Conversely, if you have moisture trapped in the attic, the temperature difference can lead to mold growth. Always check for damp spots to rule out the <a href="house-burping-and-mold.html">risk of mold associated with house noises</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            If the noises are persistent and accompanied by drafts, you may need to look into air sealing to reduce the Stack Effect. For a full list of remedies, check our guide on <a href="how-to-stop-house-burping.html">how to stop house burping</a>.
