         <p class="intro-text">
            Every house speaks, but you need to know when it's screaming for help. Most "burps" are benign, but some cracks and groans indicate foundation failure.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The "Cosmetic" Crack</h2>
         <p>
            Hairline cracks above door frames are usually normal settling. Furthermore, in the dead of winter, you may see cracks appear where the wall meets the ceiling. This is frequently <a href="roof-truss-uplift-noises.html">roof truss uplift</a>, a phenomenon caused by temperature differences in your attic, not a collapsing roof. These cracks often close up when summer returns.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The Sounds of Failure vs. Nature</h2>
         <p>
            Structural failure is rarely quiet, but not all loud noises are structural.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Loud Bangs:</strong> Usually thermal contraction or <a href="house-burping-cold-weather.html">winter stack effect issues</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Scratching/Scurrying:</strong> This is biological, not structural. Review our guide on <a href="pest-noises-vs-house-settling.html">pests vs. settling noises</a> to rule out mice.</li>
            <li><strong>Creaking in Storms:</strong> Usually just <a href="wind-noises-in-house.html">wind load flexing</a> or loose siding.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Red Flags</h2>
         <p>
            You should be concerned if you see "stair-step" cracks in brickwork, doors that refuse to close, or windows that shatter spontaneously. These are signs of foundation shifts. Moisture is often the enemy here; ensure you don't have hidden leaks causing <a href="house-burping-and-mold.html">mold and rot that weakens the frame</a>.
         </p>

            <h3 class="text-orange">⚠️ Immediate Action</h3>
            <p>
               If you suspect structural damage, do not rely on internet advice. Read our guide on <a href="when-to-call-a-professional.html">when to call a structural engineer</a> immediately.
