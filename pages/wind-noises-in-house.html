         <p class="intro-text">
            When a storm rolls in, your house becomes a sail. The wind exerts tremendous force on your walls and roof, leading to a symphony of moans, creaks, and whistles.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Positive and Negative Pressure</h2>
         <p>
            Wind doesn't just push; it pulls. The windward side of your house experiences <strong>positive pressure</strong> (pushing in), while the leeward side experiences <strong>negative pressure</strong> (suction). This push-pull dynamic causes the wood framing to flex slightly, leading to the groans often described in our <a href="what-is-house-burping.html">definition of house burping</a>.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Loose Siding and Vents</h2>
         <p>
            A rapid "clattering" sound during high wind is rarely structural. It is almost always loose vinyl siding or an unsecured soffit vent flapping against the house.
         </p>
         <p>
            If the sound is a high-pitched whistle, it indicates air leaks. The wind is forcing air through gaps in windows or doors. While annoying, this helps you identify areas to seal, which improves efficiency and reduces <a href="house-burping-hvac.html">load on your HVAC system</a>.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Tree Rubbing</h2>
         <p>
            A screeching or scratching sound during wind events is often tree limbs rubbing against the roof or siding. This should be addressed immediately. Not only does it damage shingles, but it also creates a bridge for pests, complicating the diagnosis of <a href="house-burping-at-night.html">nighttime noises</a>.
         </p>

            <h3 class="text-orange">⚠️ Wind Load Safety</h3>
            <p>
               All houses are designed to flex, but excessive movement in high winds can be concerning in older structures. If you feel the floor shake significantly during gusts, refer to our guide on <a href="structural-or-normal.html">structural safety vs. normal flexing</a> and consider getting an inspection.
            </p>
         </div>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Fixing the Noise</h2>
         <p>
            To silence the wind, you must secure the exterior shell:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Trim back all tree branches.</li>
            <li>Caulk gaps around windows (stopping the whistle).</li>
            <li>Secure loose fascia boards and siding.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
