         <p class="intro-text">
            Houses are not static sculptures; they are dynamic systems that react to their environment. Understanding the root cause of a "burp," "pop," or "groan" is the first step in determining if you need a contractor or just earplugs.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">1. Thermal Expansion and Contraction</h2>
         <p>
            The most common culprit is temperature. As the sun heats your roof, materials expand. At night, they cool and shrink. This movement creates friction between framing members. This is especially prevalent during extreme seasonal shifts. In fact, specific phenomena like <a href="house-burping-cold-weather.html">the "Stack Effect" in cold weather</a> can significantly amplify these noises, turning a quiet home into a noisy one as the thermometer drops.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">2. Differential Settlement</h2>
         <p>
            All houses settle over time. However, different materials settle at different rates. When wood dries out and shrinks (curing), it can pull away from concrete or drywall. In winter, you might notice cracks where the wall meets the ceiling; this is often a specific issue known as <a href="roof-truss-uplift-noises.html">roof truss uplift</a>, which sounds alarming but is rarely a structural failure.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">3. Mechanical Systems (HVAC & Plumbing)</h2>
         <p>
            Your home's circulatory system is noisy. Metal ducts expand when the furnace kicks on, creating a "banging" or "oil-canning" sound. Similarly, plumbing issues can mimic structural sounds. A repetitive popping sound from the basement is frequently caused by <a href="water-heater-popping-noise.html">sediment buildup in your water heater</a>, a condition known as kettling.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">4. Environmental Factors</h2>
         <p>
            External forces play a massive role. High velocity air pressure against siding causes <a href="wind-noises-in-house.html">wind-induced creaks and moans</a>. Additionally, if you are deliberately "burping your house" to improve air quality, you might be dealing with humidity changes that trigger <a href="house-burping-allergies-ventilation.html">ventilation and allergy concerns</a>.
         </p>

            <h3 class="text-orange">⚠️ When to Worry</h3>
            <p>
               Most causes listed above are benign. However, if noises are accompanied by sticking doors or sloping floors, consult our guide on <a href="structural-or-normal.html">distinguishing structural damage from normal settling</a>.
