         <p class="intro-text">
            You walk into an upstairs bedroom in January and notice a crack running along the seam where the wall meets the ceiling. You panic, thinking the roof is collapsing. Fortunately, this is a common phenomenon known as <strong>Roof Truss Uplift</strong>.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The Physics: A Tale of Two Temperatures</h2>
         <p>
            Modern roof trusses are triangular wooden frames. The bottom piece of wood (the bottom chord) is buried under insulation, keeping it warm and dry. The top pieces (top chords) are exposed to the freezing attic air.
         </p>
         <p>
            The top chords freeze and contract (shrink), while the bottom chord stays warm. This size disparity causes the truss to "arch" or bow upward in the center. This lifting action pulls the ceiling drywall up with it, creating a crack at the wall joint. This is one of the most technical <a href="house-burping-causes.html">causes of house burping</a>.
         </p>


         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Is My Roof Failing?</h2>
         <p>
            Generally, no. Truss uplift is a cosmetic issue caused by environmental factors, not a structural failure. It is distinctly different from the symptoms discussed in our <a href="structural-or-normal.html">structural damage vs. normal settling guide</a>. The cracks usually close back up in the summer when temperatures equalize.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">New Construction vs. Old Homes</h2>
         <p>
            Interestingly, this is more common in newer homes with engineered trusses and heavy insulation. Older homes with stick-framing (rafters) rarely suffer from this specific type of uplift.

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">How to Fix It</h2>
         <p>
            Trying to patch the crack in winter is futile; it will just open again.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Floating Corners:</strong> The permanent fix involves un-screwing the drywall from the truss at the corners, allowing the drywall to flex without cracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Insulation Check:</strong> Sometimes, ensuring insulation covers the top chords can help equalize temperature, but be careful not to block vents, which creates a <a href="house-burping-and-mold.html">mold risk</a>.</li>
         </ul>
