         <p class="intro-text">
            Does your basement sound like someone is making popcorn inside a metal drum? This specific type of "house burp" is almost exclusively caused by your water heater. It is known in the industry as "kettling."
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The Cause: Sediment Buildup</h2>
         <p>
            Over time, minerals in your water (calcium and magnesium) settle at the bottom of the tank. When the burner turns on to heat the water, these trapped water pockets underneath the sediment layer boil instantly into steam bubbles. When these bubbles escape the sediment layer, they burst, creating a popping sound.
         </p>
         <p>
            While this is distinct from general <a href="house-burping-hvac.html">HVAC and furnace noises</a>, it is a sign that your appliance is struggling and losing efficiency.
         </p>


         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Is it Dangerous?</h2>
         <p>
            The noise itself isn't dangerous, but the condition causing it can damage the tank. The sediment layer creates a barrier that overheats the metal bottom of the tank, potentially leading to leaks.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you are hearing this noise in a brand new home, it might be installation error, but it is far more common in older systems. See our comparison on <a href="house-burping-new-vs-old-house.html">noises in new vs. old houses</a> to understand the expected lifespan of these units.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The Fix: Flushing the Tank</h2>
         <p>
            The solution is relatively straightforward:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>Turn off the water heater (gas or electric).</li>
            <li>Connect a garden hose to the drain valve.</li>
            <li>Drain the tank to flush out the white, sandy sediment.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>

            <p>
               If the tank is rumbling violently or leaking, do not attempt a DIY fix. You need to determine if the issue is <a href="structural-or-normal.html">structural failure of the tank</a> or a simple valve issue. When in doubt, review <a href="when-to-call-a-professional.html">when to call a professional</a> to avoid a flooded basement.
