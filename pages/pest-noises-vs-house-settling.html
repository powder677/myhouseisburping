         <p class="intro-text">
            Few things trigger insomnia faster than a mysterious sound in the wall at 2 AM. Before you panic, it is vital to distinguish between the biotic (living pests) and the abiotic (structural movement).
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The Rhythm of the Noise</h2>
         <p>
            The biggest tell is rhythm. Structural settling is usually singular and sporadic. You might hear a loud pop, and then silence for hours. This is typically just the building materials reacting to <a href="house-burping-causes.html">various causes like temperature or humidity</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Pests, however, are industrious. Their noises are repetitive:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Scrabbling/Scratching:</strong> Usually indicates mice or rats trying to gain traction or gnaw through drywall.</li>
            <li><strong>Rolling:</strong> Often acorns being moved by squirrels in the attic.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluttering:</strong> Indicates birds or bats in the chimney or vents.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Time of Day Matters</h2>
         <p>
            While thermal expansion happens mostly when the sun hits the roof, thermal <em>contraction</em> happens when the sun goes down. This is why many people confuse settling with nocturnal pests. If the noise happens at a precise time every night (e.g., when the heating turns off), review our guide on <a href="house-burping-at-night.html">house burping noises at night</a> to rule out mechanical cooling.
         </p>


         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The "Normalcy" Check</h2>
         <p>
            If the noise is a dull thud or a wooden creak, ask yourself: <a href="is-house-burping-normal.html">Is this house burping normal?</a> In most cases, wood frame compression is standard behavior. However, if the noise is accompanied by the smell of ammonia (urine) or visible droppings, the noise is almost certainly biological.

            <h3 class="text-slate-blue">💡 Health Insight</h3>
            <p>Pests often seek out areas with high moisture. If you confirm pests, check that area for water leaks, as you may also be facing <a href="house-burping-and-mold.html">mold risks associated with damp walls</a>.</p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">When to Call the Exterminator</h2>
         <p>
            If you hear vocalizations (squeaking) or rapid movement across a ceiling, it is not the house settling. At this stage, a structural engineer won't help you. You need to know <a href="when-to-call-a-professional.html">when to call a professional</a> exterminator versus a contractor.
