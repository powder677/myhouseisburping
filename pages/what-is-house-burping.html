         <p class="intro-text">
            The term "House Burping" is a colloquialism that confuses many homeowners because it actually refers to two completely different things. Depending on who you ask, it's either a terrifying noise or a healthy habit.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Definition 1: The Noise (Structural Release)</h2>
         <p>
            Most commonly, a "house burp" is a sudden release of built-up pressure in the building materials. This sounds like a loud pop, bang, or crack. It is caused by the frame of the house adjusting to temperature or humidity.
         </p>
         <p>
            This can be environmental (like <a href="house-burping-cold-weather.html">loud cracks during freezing weather</a>) or mechanical. For example, a water heater filled with sediment will make a "popping" sound, often described as <a href="water-heater-popping-noise.html">burping or kettling</a>.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Definition 2: The Action (Air Exchange)</h2>
         <p>
            In the context of green building and health, "burping a house" means opening all windows and doors for a short period (10-15 minutes) to rapidly flush out stale, pollutant-filled air and replace it with fresh outdoor air.
         </p>
         <p>
            This practice is vital for reducing indoor CO2 levels and managing humidity. For a deep dive into this definition, read our guide on <a href="house-burping-allergies-ventilation.html">burping your house for allergies and ventilation</a>.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Which One Do You Have?</h2>
         <p>
            If you are hearing noises at night, you are experiencing Definition 1. You need to investigate the source. Is it the <a href="wind-noises-in-house.html">wind rattling the siding</a>? Is it <a href="house-burping-hvac.html">ductwork expanding</a>? Or is it something more concerning?
