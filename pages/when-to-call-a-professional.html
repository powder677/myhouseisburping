         <h1>House Burping: When to Worry and Call a Professional</h1>

         <p>
            We have established on our <a href="/">Home>homepage</a> that houses are noisy creatures. Most of the time, these sounds are benign conversations between wood, metal, and air. But sometimes, a house "burp" is actually a scream for help.
         </p>
         <p>
            Knowing <strong>when to call an expert for house noises</strong> can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. If DIY fixes and patience haven't stopped the noise, you need to assess the risk level. This guide distinguishes between "annoying" and "dangerous."

            <h2>Top 5 Warning Signs (When to Worry)</h2>
            <p>
               If your house is making noises <em>and</em> showing any of these symptoms, it is no longer a <a href="is-house-burping-normal.html">normal house sound</a>. It is a <strong>structural concern</strong>.
            </p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>The "Gunshot" + Cracks:</strong> A loud bang is common in <a href="house-burping-cold-weather.html">freezing cold weather</a>. However, if it leaves a jagged crack in your drywall, you need to check if it's just <a href="roof-truss-uplift-noises.html">roof truss uplift</a> (cosmetic) or foundation failure (critical).
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>The Hiss + Smell (Gas):</strong> If you hear a hissing or "burping" sound near a utility line and smell rotten eggs, leave the house immediately. This is a gas leak.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>The Sizzle (Electrical):</strong> A buzzing or sizzling sound behind a wall, often accompanied by a fishy or burning plastic smell, indicates arcing wires. This is a fire hazard.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>The Wet Thud:</strong> If you hear a dull thud or dripping sound in a ceiling, followed by a stain appearing, you have an active plumbing leak or roof failure. Ensure this isn't just <a href="house-burping-allergies-ventilation.html">condensation from poor ventilation</a>.
               </li>
               <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                  <strong>The Scrabble (Pests):</strong> Scratching, scampering, or chewing sounds are not thermal expansion. Review our guide on <a href="pest-noises-vs-house-settling.html">identifying pest noises</a> versus settling before calling a builder.

            <h2>Who to Call: A Routing Guide</h2>
            <p>
               "House burping" is vague. To get the right help, you need to match the sound to the correct trade.
            </p>

            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #3498db;">
               <h3>For "Burping" & Gurgling</h3>
               <p><strong>The Pro:</strong> Licensed Plumber.</p>
               <p><strong>Why:</strong> The issue is likely a blocked vent stack. However, if the sound is coming specifically from your hot water tank, read about <a href="water-heater-popping-noise.html">water heater popping noises</a> first.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #e74c3c;">
               <h3>For "Popping" & Banging</h3>
               <p><strong>The Pro:</strong> HVAC Technician.</p>
               <p><strong>Why:</strong> If the sound syncs with your heat turning on, it's ductwork. A pro can install flexible transitions or resize ducts to stop the <strong>HVAC inspection</strong> failures.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #f39c12;">
               <h3>For "Creaking" & Cracking</h3>
               <p><strong>The Pro:</strong> Structural Engineer.</p>
               <p><strong>Why:</strong> If the floors slope or the cracks are wider than 1/8th of an inch, or if the noise only happens during storms (see: <a href="wind-noises-in-house.html">wind noises</a>), you need a professional assessment.</p>
