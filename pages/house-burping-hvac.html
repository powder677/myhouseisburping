         <p class="intro-text">
            It’s 2:00 AM. The house is silent, until a loud "CRACK" wakes you up. Why does it seem like your house saves all its noises for when you are trying to sleep? The answer lies in physics and psychology.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Rapid Cooling (Thermal Contraction)</h2>
         <p>
            During the day, the sun heats your roof and siding. When the sun sets, the temperature drops rapidly. This causes materials to shrink. This rapid contraction builds up kinetic energy that releases as a pop. This is significantly more intense during winter months, leading to specific <a href="house-burping-cold-weather.html">cold weather noise phenomena</a>.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">The "Quiet Factor"</h2>
         <p>
            Ambient noise levels drop drastically at night. The hum of traffic, TVs, and conversation disappears. A noise that you wouldn't even register at 2 PM sounds like a gunshot at 2 AM. However, you must listen closely to the <em>type</em> of noise.
         </p>

         <h3 class="text-orange">Crucial Distinction: Is it Alive?</h3>
         <p>
            Structural popping is singular. If the noise is repetitive, scratching, or scurrying, you are likely not hearing the house settle, but rather an intruder. It is vital to learn how to <a href="pest-noises-vs-house-settling.html">distinguish pest noises from house settling</a> before you call a carpenter when you actually need an exterminator.
         </p>

         <h2 class="section-header text-slate-blue">Wind and Weather</h2>
         <p>
            Without the buffer of daytime noise, the wind becomes much more noticeable. If you hear creaking that coincides with gusts outside, you are hearing <a href="wind-noises-in-house.html">wind loading on your siding and frame</a>. This is usually harmless flexing, provided your <a href="house-burping-and-mold.html">exterior is sealed against moisture</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            If the noises are keeping you up, you might need to adjust your humidity levels or investigate your HVAC ducts. See our full list of <a href="how-to-stop-house-burping.html">solutions to stop the noise</a>.
